# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction Project

**IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (Coursera)**

This project analyzes and predicts the landing success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage boosters using **EDA, SQL, interactive maps, dashboards, and machine learning models**.

---

## Overview

The project explores Falcon 9 launches to identify factors that determine whether the first stage lands successfully.  
It includes several key parts:

- **EDA with SQL** – Analyze data stored in databases  
- **EDA with Visualization** – Explore data using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- **Folium Maps** – Visualize launch site locations and measure distances  
- **Plotly Dash Dashboard** – Interactive charts for success rates and payload relationships  
- **Machine Learning Models** – Predict landing success using Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree

##  How to Run

### Folium Map
Generates an interactive map showing launch sites and calculated distances.

```bash
python make_spacex_folium_map_unified.py
